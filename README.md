## Requirements
This app is written in __.Net Core 3.1__, so you'll need the correct runtime for this. But don't worry, you can download it [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/current/runtime).</br>
Also, a Windows computer is required (tested with Windows 10 1903+, but other versions should work too). <br/>

TL;DR: You need
* [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/software-download/windows10)
* [.Net Core 3.1 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/current/runtime)

## Why? Can't you just disable sleep!

If you can, disable sleep. If not, use this application. Simple as that.
